# WM-811K-W-GAN-model
WGAN is used to address class imbalance in the WM-811k wafer map dataset by generating realistic samples of rare defect classes. By minimizing Wasserstein distance, WGAN ensures stable training and diverse outputs, helping balance the dataset and improve classification of minority classes.
